# mis2402semester

The purpose of this project is to utilize concepts learned throughout the semester and work with real data of our choosing. 
I chose to use the business tax receipts that were issued in Orlando.  Data is provided by the city of Orlando and provides information such as the license number, business type, number of employees, and license date. The specific information I used 
were the open year and the license type. I chose this API because I wanted to use a city's database that I was familiar with since I had grown up there. There are so many businesses that open within Orlando due to the theme parks being there and with that, the amount of tourists that visit the city. 

The first chart I created was a trend/line graph. This is with the intention of the x-axis being  the year of when the business licenseâ€™s last issued date and the y-axis being the sum of businesses within that year. With this, I am hoping to show the potential decrease of issued dates during the COVID pandemic since within this time, businesses were not starting to rise within the city and 
many other cities around the United States. While it only takes the information from the first 1000 results, you can see an increase 
around 2005. This could signal that either there was an event to cause businesses to rise or that the economy was doing well that owners could put licenses out in the area. 

The second chart I would create is a bar chart for comparison of the different kinds of licenses in Orlando.  The x-axis being the license type and the y-axis being the number of licenses that match the type. The purpose of this chart would be to compare the number of a certain type of license to how many businesses wish to implement businesses in that area. Viewing this chart, we can see that professional licenses are the most occurring and that merchant licenses types are the lowest amount within the 5 types I selected.
